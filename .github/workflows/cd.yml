name: CD Pipeline - Deploy to Railway

# ⚠️ DISABLED - Railway deploys automatically via GitHub integration
# Railway is already connected and deploys when you push to main
# No need for manual deployment via GitHub Actions
#
# To use this workflow:
# 1. Make sure Railway is NOT already auto-deploying
# 2. Get your service name: run `railway service list` locally
# 3. Add RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME secret in GitHub
# 4. Uncomment the workflow_dispatch trigger below

on:
  # workflow_dispatch:  # Uncomment to enable manual deployment
  push:
    branches: [ never ]  # Disabled - will never trigger

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Railway (Disabled)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: false  # This workflow is disabled
    
    steps:
    - name: Disabled
      run: |
        echo "⚠️  This workflow is disabled"
        echo "✅ Railway auto-deploys from main branch"
        echo "✅ No action needed - your app is already deploying!"
        exit 0
